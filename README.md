# CSCI 3601 Lab #3 - Angular
In this lab you will learn to use AngularJS to simplify the addition of interactive elements such as forms, navbars, footers, and buttons to your projects. In addition, Angular makes it easier to reuse elements like navbars and footers across multiple pages in a website.

You will continue to use continuous integration and Test Driven Development (TDD). To this end, you will now set up Travis entirely yourselves (don't worry, it's like 3 extra steps from the last lab).

Your specific tasks for this lab can be found in the [LABTASKS.md](LABTASKS.md) file in this repository.

#Setup:
Install dependencies with gradle by running:

> todo: add this information

#Running Your Project:

> todo: add this information

#Testing Your Project

> todo: add this information

#Reviewing Test Coverage

> todo: add this information

> Protip: Check this frequently. Especially when you want to consider specific functionality "completed".

#Continuous Integration with Travis (Part 2)

We're bringing back Travis for this lab (and the rest that you will do). This time, Travis will run Grunt whenver is performs a build in order to run your tests.

We will have you do a bit more to get Travis set up this time around.
What you need to do:
- Add a .travis.yml file to the root of the repository.
  - In it, add the following:
```
todo: add this information
```

> Protip: From here, the rest is the same process as in lab 2. Refer to that lab if you have forgotten. This time though, you will add a build status image to the README.md rather than updating the old.
